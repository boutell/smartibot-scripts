# smartibot-scripts

Fun JavaScript programs to run on your [smartibot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/460355237/smartibot-the-worlds-first-ai-enabled-cardboard-ro), using the [smartibot IDE](https://thecraftyrobot.net/smartibot_ide/). See also the [smartibot JavaScript reference page](https://www.espruino.com/Smartibot). Smartibot is powered by [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com/), a "system on a chip" that understands a large subset of the JavaScript programming language.

To run these scripts just copy and paste them into the [smartibot IDE](https://thecraftyrobot.net/smartibot_ide/). You may need to enable Bluetooth in Chrome first.
